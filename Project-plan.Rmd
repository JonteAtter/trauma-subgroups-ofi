Background

<!-- Notera att jag la till ==== under Introduction, detta kommer tillse att Introduction blir formaterat som en rubrik när du sedan "knitar", alltså gör om ditt dokument till PDF/DOC osv. Googla/youtuba Rmarkdown för ytterligare knep/knåp. -->

Trauma is a wide term including various physical injuries to the human body. 
It is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the world, 
representing about 9 % of annual global deaths. Over the last decade almost 
50 million people worldwide have died from trauma.[@GBD_2017_Causes_of_Death_Collaborators2018-oe]

Not only does trauma represent a large share of the global mortality rate, but studies 
have also shown a significant difference in outcome depending on where patients are
treated. It has for example been shown that trauma patients in Sweden who were 
treated at a trauma center rather than a non-trauma center have a 41 % lower 
30-day adjusted mortality rate<!--Compared to? SVAR: Compared to those treated at a non trauma center -->. [@Candefjord2022-pe] 

To further stress the need for more knowledge and research about Trauma care,
some studies indicate that the number of trauma-related deaths that
potentially could have been prevented is as high as 20 to over 50 %. [@Drake2020-kx; @Ray2016-jo; @Ghorbani2018-dh] Preventable deaths varies not only between trauma centers and non-trauma centers. There is a significant difference between high income counties and low and middle income countries (LMICs). It is estimated that 2 million lives could be saved annually if LMICs and high income countries had equal fatality numbers for severe injuries.[@Mock2012-lx]  <!-- Jag skulle lägga till ytterligare meningar här  -->

Knowledge gap 
------------

Today It is poorly understood whether different subgroups have greater 
opportunities for improvement (OFI) than others. The most common cause of death after injury is hemorrhage. Among these patients, problem in decision making, technical skills and making decisions between surgery and radiology were some of the areas where OFIs were found.[@OReilly2013] <!-- ge vanliga exempel, se exv: -->

Since trauma patients is a very heterogeneous group, it is important to have a 
sufficient understanding of OFIs for different trauma subgroups.[@Coats2020-wj] <!--Sant, behöver dock källa. Jag skulle också lägga detta mot slutet i introduktionen för att tydligt kunna knyta ann till ditt aim. -->

Aim
------------
In this study we aim to assess the frequency of opportunity for improvement in the following
important clinical subgroups. Men and women, blunt and penetrating injuries, minor and major 
trauma ,and across body regions injured. 

Trauma Registries
------------

In sweden there is a national trauma register (SweTrau) holdng records of trauma cases from 48 out of 49 hospitals who recieves major trauma. To meet the inclusions criterias for SweTrau you must be over 15 years of age, been exposed to a traumatic event serious enough to activate the Trauma code in the hospital or have a NISS over 15 without trauma code activation. [@swetrau]

The exclusion criterias for SweTrau are as following:
Patients where the only traumatic injury is a chronic subdural hematoma
Patients where a trauma alarm is triggered without an underlying traumatic event.[@swetrau]
 
The KUH trauma register is a part of the Swedish Trauma Register, with the same inclusion and exclusion critera. (källa jonatan, VAR FINNS INFO OM KAROLINSKAS REGISTER?)

The Trauma Quality Database (TCQD) holds all all severe trauma cases treated at KUH Solna. VAR FINNS MER INFO OM TCQD?

Advanced Trauma Life Support and Primary Trauma Care
------------
Several different systems are being used in Trauma care. 
Such as Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and Primary Trauma Care (PTC), 
where ATLS is the more established system. The purpose of these systems is to 
secure a time-efficient, standardized and structured way of treating trauma 
patients.[@FACS; @Kadhum2020-wa]

ATLS is practiced in over 80 countries and 1 million doctors have gone thru 
this training.[@FACS] 

PTC is also used in over 80 countries, however more 
frequently in low and middle-income countries. One reason for this could be that 
the PTC program is free while ATLS is not.[@Kadhum2020-wa]

Tycker ni att jag kan beskriva de olika systemen mer i detalj här för utfyllnad?


Oppotrunity for improvement
------------

Whether there is opportunity for improvement for a specific case or not is decided by a group of experts during a conference where every trauma case is discussed. OFI is defined as when the trauma care for a patient does not match the best practice guidelines in at least one aspect.

At KUH all trauma patient end up in a data base. Audit filters then point out certain trauma cases where things might have differed from the golden standard treatment based on different criterias. Such criterias are GCS 8 ol less where the patient was not intubated, time to CT, time to Surgery and so on. Then A manual selection is done by a nurse, where some cased are removed from the group of potential OFI cases because obvious reasons for the treatment can be found. The patients who are then left are discussed at a conference where doctors from several specialties participate. At this conference every case is gone through thoroughly. Then those patients where OFI is found are marked with "YES" in the OFI colomn in the KUH Trauma register and those patient where no OFI is found are mared with "NO".

Injury severity score 
------------
The Injury severity score (ISS) is an anatomic severity scale developed to assess multiple-injured patients. The ISS score a patient get is based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) points from the injured body regions. The higher ISS score the more serious injury the patients suffers from.[@ISS]

ISS takes injuries in 6 different body regions into account. Those are head/neck, face, chest, abdomen, extremiteis and external. The ISS is the sum of the squares of the highest AIS code in each of the three most severely injured ISS Body Regions. AIS can vary from 1-5, and the ISS from 1-75.[@ISS]

Initial Trauma care
------------

Trauma patients are divided into priority one and two by the paramedics using certain criteria, such as trauma mechanism, GCS points and blood pressure. To Karolinska Solna only those who are classified as a priority one by the pre hospital professionals are admitted. [@Granstrom2012]

A Trauma priority one is considered directly life thretening. Therefore when arriving to Karolinska Solna every one of these patients are taken care of by a full trauma team. This team consists of a trauma leader wo is a general surgeon or a resident in general surgury and an anesthetist with a nurse specialized in anesthesiology. The team also has an rthopedic surgeon, radiologist, radiology nurse, emergency medicine nurse, surgical nurse and assistant nurses.[@Granstrom2012]


Methods
=====

<!--Stora delar av det du skriver ovan hör hemma i metoddelen. Se Elias och Husseins arbeten -->

Study design
------------
This is a registry based cohort study that uses data from two different Swedish
trauma registers. The first one is the Trauma registry at the Karolinska 
University Hospital in Solna, which includes about 21000 patients between the 
years 2012 and 2021. The second register is the Trauma quality database (TCQD) which is a subset of the trauma registry and includes about 2200 patients selected for review between 2014 and 2021.

By linking these databases together the opportunity for improvement in the trauma 
subgroups mentioned in the introduction will be assessed.

Whether there is opportunity for improvement for a specific case or not is identified by the multidisciplinary review board where every trauma case is discussed. OFI is defined as when the trauma care for a patient does not match the best practice guidelines in at least one aspect.

At KUH all trauma patient end up in a data base. Audit filters then point out certain trauma cases where things might have differed from the golden standard treatment based on different criterias. Such criterias are GCS 8 ol less where the patient was not intubated, time to CT, time to Surgery and so on. Then A manual selection is done by a nurse, where some cased are removed from the group of potential OFI cases because obvious reasons for the treatment can be found. The patients who are then left are discussed at a conference where doctors from several specialties participate. At this conference every case is gone through thoroughly. Then those patients where OFI is found are marked with "YES" in the OFI colomn in the KUH Trauma register and those patient where no OFI is found are mared with "NO".

Ethical considerations
=====

All patients have given consent before added to Swetrau and TCQD. As this is a registry based study no interventions were made that could effect the patients. The only risk with this typ of studies is that personal information could leak. In these registers however, all personal data was scrambled to minimize that risk. 

Ethical permission has been granted for tis project. Dnr number for this permission is 2021-02541 and 2021-0253.

DET STÅR ATT ALLA GETT MEDGIVANDE FÖR ATT LÄGGAS TILL I SWETRAU PÅ DERAS HEMSIDA. MEN HUR FUNKAR DET MED DE SOM DOG INNAN SAMTYCKE GAVS? Jonatan pratade om att man antog samtycke för de patienterna. Men hittar ingen info om detta. 


En skriftlig redogörelse av projektets utveckling
=====

All data är redan insamlad från start och finns tillgängliga i de register som beskrivs i projektredogörelsen. Datan kommer delas in efter olika trauma-subgrupper. De variabler som kommer användas är "Ja" där det finns "Opportunity for improvement" samt "nej" där det inte finns "opportunity for improvement.

Hittills har jag
- Läst in mig på ämnet
- Skrivit Introduktion
- Påbörjat materiela och metod
- Börjat sätta mig in i R som är det program som kommer användas för att sammanställa data.

• Hur data planeras presenteras (t ex tabeller och hur de kan struktureras, diagramtyper, 
vävnadssnitt, intervjucitat etc) 

Datan kommer presenteras i en tabell där de aktuella subgrupperna kommer presenteras samt huruvuda det finns OFI för dessa grupper. Det kommer även redogöras för i vilken utsträckning varje subgrupp har OFI. 

• Hur data planeras analyseras; vilka statistiska metoder för jämförelser mellan en eller 
flera grupper, andra matematiska metoder, kvalitativ analys etc --> Detta skulle jag behöva diskutera med er innan jag kan svara.


Ingen reservplan behövs då all data finns insamlad och risken för att projektet inte går att genomföra somplanerat bedöms minimal.
