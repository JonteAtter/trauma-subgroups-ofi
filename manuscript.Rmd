Introduction

Trauma is a wide term including various physical injuries to the human body. 
It is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the world, 
representing about 9 % of annual global deaths. Over the last decade almost 
50 million people world wide have died from trauma.(1)

Since trauma is a multifaceted clinical entity, it is very important to have a 
sufficient understanding of treatment and resources for every different trauma 
subgroup. Such as men and women, blunt and penetrating injury, minor and major 
trauma and across body regions injured. It has for example been shown that 
trauma patients in Sweden who were treated at a trauma center rather than a 
non-trauma center have a 41 % lower 30-day adjusted mortality rate. (2)

To further stress the need for more knowledge and research about Trauma care,
some studies indicate that the number of trauma related deaths that
potentially could have been prevented is as high as 20-40 %. (3,4)

Today however, it is poorly understood whether different subgroups have greater 
opportunities for improvement than others. Such opportunities for improvement 
could be lack of resources and management errors. 

In this study we aim to assess the frequency of oppotunity for improvement in
important clinical subgroups.



<!-- Explain the scientific background and rationale for the
investigation being reported. End by stating the aim or specific
objectives, including any prespecified hypotheses. The introduction
should not be longer than 1-1.5 pages, typically 4-5 paragraphs, each
6-8 lines long. Support every statement with a citation -->

Methods 

This is a registry based cohort study that uses data from two different Swedish
trauma registers. The first one is the Trauma registry at the Karolinska 
University Hospital in Solna, which includes about 21000 patients between the 
years 2012 and 2021. The second register is the Trauma quality database. By 
linking these databases together the opportunity for improvement in the trauma 
subgroups mentioned in the introduction will be assessed.

Results


<!-- 

Participants
------------

(a) Report numbers of individuals at each stage of study—eg numbers
potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible,
included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed

(b) Give reasons for non-participation at each stage

(c) Consider use of a flow diagram

Descriptive data
----------------

(a) Give characteristics of study participants (eg demographic,
clinical, social) and information on exposures and potential
confounders

(b) Indicate number of participants with missing data for each
variable of interest

(c) Cohort study — Summarise follow-up time (eg, average and total
amount)

Outcome data
------------

Cohort study — Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures
over time

Case-control study — Report numbers in each exposure category, or
summary measures of exposure

Cross-sectional study — Report numbers of outcome events or summary
measures

Main results
------------

(a) Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted
estimates and their precision (eg, 95% confidence interval). Make
clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included

(b) Report category boundaries when continuous variables were
categorized

(c) If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into
absolute risk for a meaningful time period

Other analyses 
--------------

Report other analyses done—eg analyses of subgroups and interactions,
and sensitivity analyses

You can include code in this document like this:

```{r main, echo=FALSE}
source("main.R") ## This "imports" the main script file of your project and run any code in it
```

You can also embed plots:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

You can also mix text and code, so called inline code, like this: `r 2+5`.
