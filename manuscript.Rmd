Trauma is a wide term including various physical injuries to the human body. 
It is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the world, 
representing about 9 % of annual global deaths. Over the last decade almost 
50 million people worldwide have died from trauma.[@GBD_2017_Causes_of_Death_Collaborators2018-oe]

Not only does trauma represent a large share of the global mortality rate, but studies 
have also shown a significant difference in outcome depending on where patients are
treated. It has for example been shown that trauma patients in Sweden who were 
treated at a trauma center rather than a non-trauma center have a 41 % lower 
30-day adjusted mortality rate. [@Candefjord2022-pe]

To further stress the need for more knowledge and research about Trauma care,
some studies indicate that the number of trauma-related deaths that
potentially could have been prevented is as high as 20 to over 50 %. [@Drake2020-kx; @Ray2016-jo; @Ghorbani2018-dh]

Several different systems are being used in Trauma care. 
Such as Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and Primary Trauma Care (PTC), 
where ATLS is the more established system. The purpose of these systems is to 
secure a time-efficient, standardized and structured way of treating trauma 
patients.[6; @Kadhum2020-wa]

ATLS is practiced in over 80 countries and 1 million doctors have gone thru 
this training.  (6). PTC is also used in over 80 countries, however more 
frequently in low and middle-income countries. One reason for this could be that 
the PTC program is free while ATLS is not.[@Kadhum2020-wa]

Since trauma patients is a very heterogeneous group, it is important to have a 
sufficient understanding of treatment and resources for every different trauma 
subgroup. Such as men and women, blunt and penetrating injuries, minor and major 
trauma ,and across body regions injured.

Today however, it is poorly understood whether different subgroups have greater 
opportunities for improvement than others. Such opportunities for improvement 
could be lack of resources and management errors. 

In this study we aim to assess the frequency of opportunity for improvement in
important clinical subgroups.

Methods 

This is a registry based cohort study that uses data from two different Swedish
trauma registers. The first one is the Trauma registry at the Karolinska 
University Hospital in Solna, which includes about 21000 patients between the 
years 2012 and 2021. The second register is the Trauma quality database. By 
linking these databases together the opportunity for improvement in the trauma 
subgroups mentioned in the introduction will be assessed.

Whether there is opportunity for improvement for a specific case or not is decided by an group of experts during a conference where every trauma case is discussed. OFI is defined as when the trauma care for a patient does not match the best practice guidelines in at least one aspect.

Study design
------------

<!-- Present key elements of study design -->

Setting
-------

The Karolinska University Hospital in Solna is the leading trauma center in Sweden, and the only hospital in Sweden that can be considered as a level one trauma center. Trauma patients are divided into priority one and two by the paramedics using certain criteria, such as trauma mechanism, GCS points and blood pressure. To Karolinska Solna only those who are classified as a priority one by the pre hospital professionals are admitted. [@Granstrom2012]

A Trauma priority one is considered directly life thretening. Therefore when arriving to Karolinska Solna every one of these patients are taken care of by a full trauma team. This team consists of a trauma leader wo is a general surgeon or a resident in general surgury and an anesthetist with a nurse specialized in anesthesiology. The team also has a Orthopedic surgeon, Radiologist, radiology nurse, emergency medicine nurse, surgical nurse and assistant nurses.[@Granstrom2012]

<!-- Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including
periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection -->

Participants
------------
Patients included in SweTrau. To meet the inclusions criterias for SweTrau you must be over 15 years of age, been exposed to a traumatic event serious enough to activate the Trauma code in the hospital and have a NISS over 15. (https://rcsyd.se/swetrau/om-swetrau/about-swetrau-in-english/swetrau-the-swedish-trauma-registry)

The exclusion criterias for SweTrau are as following:
Patients where the only traumatic injury is a chronic subdural hematoma
Patients where a trauma alarm is triggered without an underlying traumatic event.(https://rcsyd.se/swetrau/om-swetrau/about-swetrau-in-english/swetrau-the-swedish-trauma-registry)
