Trauma is a wide term including various physical injuries to the human body. 
It is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the world, 
representing about 9 % of annual global deaths. Over the last decade almost 
50 million people worldwide have died from trauma.[@GBD_2017_Causes_of_Death_Collaborators2018-oe]

Not only does trauma represent a large share of the global mortality rate, but studies 
have also shown a significant difference in outcome depending on where patients are
treated. It has for example been shown that trauma patients in Sweden who were 
treated at a trauma center rather than a non-trauma center have a 41 % lower 
30-day adjusted mortality rate<!--Compared to? SVAR: Compared to those treated at a non trauma center -->. [@Candefjord2022-pe] 

To further stress the need for more knowledge and research about Trauma care,
some studies indicate that the number of trauma-related deaths that
potentially could have been prevented is as high as 20 to over 50 %. [@Drake2020-kx; @Ray2016-jo; @Ghorbani2018-dh] Preventable deaths varies not only between trauma centers and non-trauma centers. There is a significant difference between high income counties and low and middle income countries (LMICs). It is estimated that 2 million lives could be saved annually if LMICs and high income countries had equal fatality numbers for severe injuries.[@Mock2012-lx]  <!-- Jag skulle lägga till ytterligare meningar här  -->

<!--mitt förslag är istället att fokusera på kvalitetsarbeten mer riktade mot systemen i stort exv MoM-konferanser -->

Today however, it is poorly understood whether different subgroups have greater 
opportunities for improvement (OFI) than others. The most common cause of death after injury is hemorrhage. Among these patients, problem in decision making, technical skills and making decisions between surgery and radiology were some of the areas where OFIs were found.[@OReilly2013] <!-- ge vanliga exempel, se exv: 

-->
Since trauma patients is a very heterogeneous group, it is important to have a 
sufficient understanding of OFIs for different trauma 
subgroups.[@Coats2020-wj] <!--Sant, behöver dock källa. Jag skulle också lägga detta mot slutet i introduktionen för att tydligt kunna knyta ann till ditt aim. -->

In this study we aim to assess the frequency of opportunity for improvement in the following
important clinical subgroups. Men and women, blunt and penetrating injuries, minor and major 
trauma ,and across body regions injured.

Methods
=====

This is a registry based cohort study that uses data from two different Swedish
trauma registers. The first one is the Trauma registry at the Karolinska 
University Hospital in Solna, which includes about 21000 patients between the 
years 2012 and 2021. The second register is the Trauma quality database. By 
linking these databases together the opportunity for improvement in the trauma 
subgroups mentioned in the introduction will be assessed.

Whether there is opportunity for improvement for a specific case or not is decided by an group of experts during a conference where every trauma case is discussed. OFI is defined as when the trauma care for a patient does not match the best practice guidelines in at least one aspect.

At KUH all trauma patient end up in a data base. Audit filters then point out certain trauma cases where things might have differed from the golden standard treatment based on different criterias. Such criterias are GCS 8 ol less where the patient was not intubated, time to CT, time to Surgery and so on. Then A manual selection is done by a nurse, where some cased are removed from the group of potential OFI cases because obvious reasons for the treatment can be found. The patients who are then left are discussed at a conference where doctors from several specialties participate. At this conference every case is gone through thoroughly. Then those patients where OFI is found are marked with "YES" in the OFI colomn in the KUH Trauma register and those patient where no OFI is found are mared with "NO".

Study design
------------

<!-- Present key elements of study design -->

Setting
-------

The Karolinska University Hospital in Solna is the leading trauma center in Sweden, and the only hospital in Sweden that can be considered as a level one trauma center. Trauma patients are divided into priority one and two by the paramedics using certain criteria, such as trauma mechanism, GCS points and blood pressure. To Karolinska Solna only those who are classified as a priority one by the pre hospital professionals are admitted. [@Granstrom2012]

A Trauma priority one is considered directly life thretening. Therefore when arriving to Karolinska Solna every one of these patients are taken care of by a full trauma team. This team consists of a trauma leader wo is a general surgeon or a resident in general surgury and an anesthetist with a nurse specialized in anesthesiology. The team also has a Orthopedic surgeon, Radiologist, radiology nurse, emergency medicine nurse, surgical nurse and assistant nurses.[@Granstrom2012]
