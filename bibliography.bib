  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Reducing the global burden of injury requires both
               injury prevention and improved trauma care. We sought to provide
               an estimate of the number of lives that could be saved by
               improvements in trauma care, especially in low income and middle
               income countries. METHODS: Prior data showed differences in case
               fatality rates for seriously injured persons (Injury Severity
               Score $\geq$ 9) in three separate locations: Seattle, WA (high
               income; case fatality 35\%); Monterrey, Mexico (middle income;
               case fatality 55\%); and Kumasi, Ghana (low income; case
               fatality 63\%). For the present study, total numbers of injury
               deaths in all countries in different economic strata were
               obtained from the Global Burden of Disease study. The number of
               lives that could potentially be saved from improvements in
               trauma care globally was calculated as the difference in current
               number of deaths from trauma in low income and middle income
               countries minus the number of deaths that would have occurred if
               case fatality rates in these locations were decreased to the
               case fatality rate in high income countries. RESULTS: Between
               1,730,000 and 1,965,000 lives could be saved in low income and
               middle income countries if case fatality rates among seriously
               injured persons could be reduced to those in high income
               countries. This amounts to 34-38\% of all injury deaths.
               CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of lives could be saved by
               improvements in trauma care globally. This is another piece of
               evidence in support of investment in and greater attention to
               strengthening trauma care services globally.",
